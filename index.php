				My oath is between
				Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of
				prisoner to that of lieutenant? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Now, how the hell do
				we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of
				himself. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

				You are now watching the throne, don't let me get in my zone. You tellin' me people don't look at Kanye West
				like the glitch? I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to
				actually be 'architected.' Because I sit back and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy? I'm a creative
				genius and there's no other way to word it. This one Corbusier lamp was, like, my greatest inspiration.
				Nobody can tell me where I can and can't go. Man, I'm the number one living and breathing rock star.

				Let me begin baby, my name is Bronsolino. Eat steaks off a cold plate. listening to Coldplay. Hide spinach
				like a doomsday prepper. Every Sunday I'm in Tuesday leather. My beard look like Uday and Qusay. Zero to 60
				in a Porsche like a cheetah. The moon's reflections off the lake hit me. All I see is C-notes, silk shirts
				at the casino. The face is silky like a tablecloth. My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a
				Chilean horse. I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Grambling. I'm sitting at the outdoor desk with
				my pants off.

			Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart. Play your part. On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this
			forever. Forever ever? But I know you wanted that 808. Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass? Ah ha, hush that fuss.
			Everybody move to the back of the bus. Do you wanna bump and slump with us? We the type of people that make the
			club get crunk. As the plot thickens it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles. When I met my
			SpottieOttieDopalicious angel, I can remember the damn thing like yesterday. Sir Lucious gots gator belts and
			patty melts and Monte Carlos. This is my story, this is my song and to them rudypoos don't attempt to try this
			at home. Chonkyfire, spiced with rock n' roll. Indubitably, piper pied. And if I see you in the streets I'd dap
			you down like you was Greg. YKK on your zipper.

			<p class="loosygoosy">Kendrick have a dream. I am a sinner who's probably going to sin again. Playstation and
				some drank.
				Technology bought my soul. Got me breathing with dragons. I crack the eggs in your basket. I'm Marilyn
				Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic. Start up that Maserati and 'Vroom! Vroom' I'm racing. I got
				25 lighters on my dresser. I can feel your energy from two planets away. I got my drink, I got my music. I
				would share them both today. I can feel the changes. I can feel the people around me just want to be
				famous.</p>

			Not if I weaken first. Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. Yesterday I did not know
			how to eat gagh. Sorry, Data. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. and attack the Romulans. We
			have a saboteur aboard. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Some days you get the bear, and some days
			the bear gets you. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. This
			should be interesting. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.
